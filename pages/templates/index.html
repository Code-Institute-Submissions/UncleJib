                <p>
                    Here at Uncle Jib's, we started out in 1953 by a small team of crazy, snow sports obsessed individuals... Also known as The Jibson family. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    They saw an opportunity and believed they could start up a unique snowboard shop inside their garage. Nearly 80 year's later, Uncle Jib's has been going from strength 
                    to strength and has just recently moved its headquaters to North Yorkshire, UK.

                    We know that there isn't much snow within the UK, but that doesnt mean there are no snowboards.

    Air off a few kickers, occasionally riding switch and at speed whenever you can. If this describes you, this page lists

                    in the deep soft white stuff. Think about the type of rider you are and how you will be using your 
                    snowboard. If you are not sure - the 'All Mountain' option is the one to go for.</p>

                        Cutting sharp edges into the piste, then blasting off into the powder at every opportunity, dropping cliffs if you dare but speed rather 
                        than air is your thing.</p>

                    <p>If you are choosing a board for use in the snow park or half pipe, spins, grabs and kickers are your thing.
                        You'd rather spin 5 than carve hard turns into the piste! You need a specialised snowboard for this kind of riding. 
                        The snowboard park is the pace for big kickers and giant air!</p>

                        You need a short, flexible, twin tip board with soft edges for sliding, jibbing and hitting boxes. Think about the type of rider 
                        you are and how you will be using your snowboard.</p>
