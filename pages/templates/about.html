                             Here at Uncle Jib's, we know how much the right snowboard can effect your riding capability. We have picked out and categorised 
                            the major 6 styles of snowboarding.
                            </p>

                            <p>Our purpose built manufacturing complex, based in Yorkshire, boasts the very latest technology in designing snowboard
                             production in the UK. Computer aided design and computer controlled manufacturing facilities work together 
                            to create an exciting range of modern and classic designs, together with the very latest innovations and  
                            designers to create unique boards.</p>
                            <p>
                            For this we know that you need the correct board that matches with your riding style. With a wide variety on site
                             we always try to have at least 12 different types of each riding style, to ensure you have a selection to choose from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            We know that snowboarding makes winter tolerable, not tolerable...enjoyable! Instead of shoveling snow from the driveway,
                             feeling the frostbite on your fingers and nose, we prefer the rush from travelling fast and flying through the air.

                    <br>
                        <p>We understand that our world is being destroyed by Green House Gases(GHGs).
                        To help fight back, we only use sustainable products which have been branded 
                        and highlighted to encourage mindful shopping. Within our warehouse, we have Solar 
                        PV and thermal generating electriciy and heat provided by the sun to allow. This is just one of the 
                        many measures we take to help fight back at GHGs!
                        </p>

                    <br>
                        <p>We dont use any plastic within our packages. We know that plastic can be recyled but at what cost? The average plastic bottle takes up to 
                         450 years to biodegrade! And did you know that roughtly 90% of plastic bottles are'nt ever recycled? Madness, isnt it!
                        Here at Uncle Jib's we try to only use cardboard. The outer packaging is 100% recyclable and not only that but you dont have to recycle it...
                        You can use it for your kid's school projects, for building a fort, for packaging up some old items you've just sold on ebay.
                        To ensure that your new snowboard isnt damaged in any way during transport, we wrap it in 'Crinkle Cut Cardboard' so if there are any 
                        bumps in it's journey, the cardboard thats all the impact. </p>
