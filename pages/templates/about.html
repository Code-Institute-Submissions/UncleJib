                     Here at Uncle Jib's, we know how much the right snowboard can effect your riding capability. We have picked out and categorised 
                    the major 6 styles of snowboarding including...

                    We know that snowboarding makes winter tolerable, not tolerable...enjoyable! Instead of shoveling snow from the driveway,
                     feeling the frostbite on your fingers and nose, we prefer the rush from travelling fast and flying through the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this we know that you need the correct board that matches with your riding style. With a wide variety on site
                     we always try to have at least 12 different types of each riding style, to ensure you have a selection to choose from.
